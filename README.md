<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

My family loves to drink, as do so many of us.  Particularly, my family loves wine.  I am always struggling to remember who likes what wine, which ones were the favorites, which wine to bring, and even just when I want something different from my go to's but don't want to "risk it" by buying a different wine that i can't remember if I liked or not.  I created this application as a personal database for tracking those wines that we try over the years that we want to remember if it was particularly good or if it was...terrible. 

With the expansion of the craft beer industry, the popularity of "beers around the world", and, for lack of better phrasing, "beer snobs", I have also included functionality to log/create a database for those of us who also want to keep track of different beers that we try.  I know you can get wine and beer ratings from other websites, but reviews are often based on professional palettes and information that the general consumer may not be interested in. Also, what one person or "expert" likes, another may not.  

So...with that being said, I created this version to specifically track YOUR wines and YOUR beers with YOUR ratings, for the lay person among us, along with most of the options to include additional information about the beverages that would be important to those with the aformentioned developed palettes.  This way you can rate the drinks personally, tailored to the only person's opinion that matter...YOU...oh yeah, and also those of your loved ones and friends.

## User Stories and Stretch Goals

MVP Goals:
* As a user, I would like to see a list of all the different wines/beers/beverages I've tried over time.
* As a user, I would like the ability to click on an entry and be presented with data about the wine(s) written in my own words.
* As a user, I would like the ability to easily add a wine to the list.
* As a user, I would like the ability remove a wine from the list.
* As a user, I would like the ability to edit or update the information to each entry as my tastes change or as I have new/different experiences.

Stretch Goals Accomplished:

* As a user, I would like to be able to store/track the beers I've tried over time in a seperate database from that of the wines, to be displayed on a seperate page.
* As a user, I would like the ability to attach a photo of the wine/beer for reference.
* As a user, I would like to be able to create a profile and log in and/or logout.
* As a user, I would like to be able to keep my wine list seperate from those of my significant other, friends or other family memebers.
* As a developer, I would like my website to incorporate some basic styling other than just what HTML renders for the user.

Additional Stretch Goals and Features in Development as of Initial Deployment:

* As a developer, I would like to revisit my CSS and upgrade/update website styling to a professional, portfolio-worthy level.
* As a developer, I would like to make the css and styling responsive to different viewing environments.
* As a user, I would like the feature added to the beer database to also make it unique to each user, as the wine database is.
*As a user, I would like a fourth model for cocktails/mixed drinks, and for this 4th model to leverage a 3rd party API to query for cocktail recipes by name, drink type, alcohol used, ingredients, taste, etc.
* As a user, I would like the ability to display additional information about the beverages unique to me, as in a "memory section", where I can upload personal picture from an event tying the wine to personal memory of an event, time, place, people, etc.  This functionality would be to create almost a memory-book aspect further personalizing user experience with the app.
* As a user, I would like to be able to search/filter results from my databases to find wines by specific features or attributes.
* As a user, I would like the ability to link to online sources to view current pricing and availability of each item.
* As a user, I would like the ability to import information from a trusted source to view professional reviews of each item.


## Biggest Challenges and Unresolved Problems/Issues:

* CSS - It was a big time suck for me when I fist began adding in css.  I wanted to do it from scratch for practice rather than using Bootstrap/similar, but it was difficult for me to re-wrap my head around styling with the ejs format in the beginning and I ended up scrapping my first attempts at more advanced CSS and after wasting half a day with this issue, I ended up just going with some basic styling that I could modify later and moved on to adding in some functionality stretch goals

* Sessions - Initial setup with sessions definitely gave me some issues to resolve around re-structuring some of my existing files to work with our sessions lessons, such as adding in a db folder and moving connections into that and also implementing dotenv and also trying to figure out how to attach ownership of database entries to specific users once sessions was established.

## What I Learned and Takeaways:

* Biggest thing I think as far as node and express goes was gaining a lot more familiarity with models, views, controllers, routes, syntax, middleware and it's many roles, abilities and functionality.
* Finally getting back in the groove with CSS.  Practice with styling is something I definitely needed and still need more of in the future. 
* Time Management - as always, things take much longer than initially planned for, which hindered my progress towards the end of the project.
